# The GVFS Protocol (v1)

The GVFS network protocol consists of four operations on three endpoints. In summary:
* `GET /gvfs/objects/{objectId}`
  * Gets a single object in loose-object format
* `POST /gvfs/objects`
  * Retrieves one or more objects in packfile or streaming loose object format
* `GET /gvfs/prefetch[?lastPackTimestamp={secondsSinceEpoch}]`
  * Retrieves one or more packfiles of non-blobs and optionally packfile indexes in a streaming format
* `POST /gvfs/sizes`
  * Retreives the uncompressed, undeltified size of one or more objects 

# `GET /gvfs/objects/{objectId}`
Will return a single object in compressed loose object format, which can be directly
written to `.git/xx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy` if desired. The request/response looks
similar to the "Dumb Protocol" as described [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols).

# `POST /gvfs/objects`
Will return multiple objects, possibly more than the client requested based on request parameters.

The request consists of a JSON body with the following format:
```
{
    "objectIds" : [ {JSON array of SHA-1 object IDs, as strings} ],
    "commitDepth" : {positive integer}
}
```

For example,
```
{
    "objectIds" : [
        "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
    ],
    "commitDepth" : 1
}
```

## `Accept: application/x-git-packfile` (the default)

If 
* An `Accept` header of  `application/x-git-packfile` is specified, or 
* No `Accept` header is specified

A git packfile, indexable via `index-pack`, will be returned to the client. 

If `objectIds` includes a `commit`, then all `tree`s recursively referenced by that commit are also returned. 
If any other object type is requested (`tree`, `blob`, or `tag`), then only that object will be returned.

`commitDepth` - if the requested object is a `commit`, all parents up to `n` levels deep will be returned, along
with all their trees as previously described. Does not include any `blob`s.

## `Accept: application/x-gvfs-loose-objects`

**NOTE**: This format is currently only supposed by the cache server, not by VSTS.

To enable scenarios where multiple objects are required, but less overhead would be incurred by using pre-existing
loose objects (e.g. on a caching proxy), an alternative, packfile-like response format that contains loose objects 
is also supported. 

To receive objects in this format, the client **MUST** supply an `Accept` header of `application/x-gvfs-loose-objects` 
to the `POST /gvfs/objects` endpoint. Otherwise, the response format will be `application/x-git-packfile`.

This format will **NOT** perform any `commit` to `tree` expansion, and will return an error if a commit depth
greater than `1` is supplied. Said another way, this `Accept`/return type has no concept of "implicitly-requested"
objects. 

### Version 1
* Integers are signed and little-endian, unless otherwise specified
* Byte offset 0 is the first byte in the file
* Index offset 0 is the first byte in the first element of an array
* `num_objects` represents the variable number of objects in the file/response

# `GET /gvfs/prefetch[?lastPackTimestamp={secondsSinceEpoch}]`

To enable the reuse of already-existing packfiles and indexes, a custom format for transmitting these files
is supported. The `prefetch` endpoint will return one or more packfiles of **non-blob** objects.  

If the optional `lastPackTimestamp` query parameter is supplied, only packs created by the server
after the specific Unix epoch time (approximately, Â±10 minutes or so) will be returned. Generally, these packs 
will contain only objects introduced to the repository after that UTC-based timestamp, but will not contain
**all** objects introduced after that timestamp.

A media-type of `application/x-gvfs-timestamped-packfiles-indexes` will be returned from this endpoint.

## Response format

* Integers are signed and little-endian, unless otherwise specified
* Byte offset 0 is the first byte in the file
* Index offset 0 is the first byte in the first element of an array
* `num_packs` represents the variable number of packs in the file/response

```

Packs **MUST** be sent in increasing `timestamp` order. In the case of a failed connection, this allows the 
client to keep the packs it received successfully and "resume" by sending the highest completed timestamp.

# `POST /gvfs/sizes`
Provides the uncompressed, undeltified length of the requested objects in JSON format.

The request consists of a JSON body with the following format:
```
[ {JSON array of SHA-1 object IDs, as strings} ]
```

For example, a request of
```
[
    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
]
```

Will result in a a response like:
```
[
    {
        "Id" : "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "Size" : 123
    },
    {
        "Id" : "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
        "Size" : 456
    }
]
```
